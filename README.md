IMDB Genre Data Analysis project

<h2> About the project </h2>
<p>These files feature my work on the understanding, cleaning and exploration of the IMDB dataset as part of my Udacity nanodegree. The main focus around the dataset is profitability of films in terms of <b>genre</b> and <b> profitability</b>.</p>

<h2>Why this project is useful</h2>
<p>This project reviews how genre impacts the profitability of films, how specific actors (or rather the popularity of the cast) can influence the overall profitability of films. However, the analysis also realises that there are severe limitations to the potential insights, due to the dataset attributes not being comprehensive enough. </p>

<h2> Further options for analysis </h2>
<p> Well, there are always further options for analysis, but some of the things that I didn't look into include the years and how popularity of genre and the profitability of films within a specific of genre can vary over time. For example, are adventure films more popular now thanks to the increase in love for films like Marvel, or has adventure always been an all-time favourite?</p>
